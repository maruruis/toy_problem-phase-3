## Project Description
Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

This challenge asks you to write a function that takes an hour, minute, and period (either "am" or "pm") as input and returns the corresponding 24-hour time in a four-digit string format.

Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive

This challenge asks you to write a function that takes three integers as input and returns True if exactly two of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False otherwise.

Challenge 3: Consonant value

This challenge asks you to write a function that takes a lowercase string containing only alphabetic characters and no spaces as input and returns the highest value of consonant substrings in the string. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou". The values for each consonant are assigned as follows: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ..., z = 26.
